Quiz 1
------

Quiz 1 was given in class, and covered material through Lecture 7 and Problem Set 3.

Additional instructions given to students:

Although the quiz is closed book, you may bring one handwritten crib sheet on an 8.5 x 11" or A4 sheet of paper. Preparing a crib sheet can be a useful study aid, so put some effort into selecting material for it. You may use both sides of the paper, but you may only use one sheet. It must be handwritten and not photocopied/printed. Calculators and programmable devices are not allowed for this quiz.
